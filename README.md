## ðŸ”„ Volere Workflow Process  
Our project follows the **Volere requirements process**, ensuring systematic analysis, design, and documentation:  

1. **Analysis of Case Study** â€“ Understanding the given scenario  
2. **Extraction of Requirements** â€“ Identifying functional & non-functional requirements  
3. **System Architecture** â€“ Designing the overall system structure  
4. **Documentation & Code Refinement** â€“ Ensuring clarity and maintainability  
5. **SysML Modelling** â€“ Using modelling techniques for system representation

## ðŸ“‚ Main Tasks  

| Task Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Project Blastoff** | Define project drivers, constraints, product issues, scope, confirmation of goals, risks & costs, and stakeholders |
| **Trawling for Requirements** | Extract non-functional & functional requirements, and capture use cases |
| **Prototyping** | Create sketches, SysML, UML, and BPMN diagrams to visualize the system |
| **Writing Requirements** | Formalize requirements using snow cards |
| **Quality Gateway** | Conduct team-based quality assurance to ensure requirements meet stakeholder needs and testing standards |
| **Reusing Requirements** | Apply iterative or incremental methodologies (Agile, Waterfall) to refine workflow |
| **Adapting Requirements** | Manage evolving requirements due to technical refinements or environmental changes |

## âœ… Key Notes  
- Requirements will **evolve iteratively**, adapting to technical and environmental changes  
- Emphasis on **quality, collaboration, and maintainability** throughout the project  
- Both **Agile and Waterfall approaches** may be referenced where appropriate
